## How to install

The app is not available through the https://www.kaiostech.com/store/ They are only accepting apps that are monetized using <a href="https://developer.kaiostech.com/submit-to-kaistore">KaiAds SDK</a>, and that's something I'm not interested in integrating.
For this reason, you have to side-load (upload) the app to your phone if you want to use it.
Martin Kaptein wrote a comprehensive, <a href="https://www.martinkaptein.com/blog/sideloading-and-deploying-apps-to-kai-os/">step-by-step article</a> that you can use to side-load the app. If you prefer a video, this one on YouTube walks you through the process.
The Developer Portal also contains a guide, and if nothing seems to work, you can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rQ93zEu">ask for help on Discord</a>.
You can download the latest version from the Releases page.
The app is not auto-updating. To update it, you have to follow the same steps you took when installing it.
